# **Report 4: The Tor Browser**
#### **Instructions**
This is a report based on the given homework at the course:
[ICT Security Basics from Trust to Blockchain ICT4HM103-3003, 2022 Spring](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/trust-to-blockchain-2022/)

**a)** v) Read/watch and summarize 

- Nakamoto, Satoshi 2008: [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) ([A colored HTML version](https://git.dhimmel.com/bitcoin-whitepaper/). This is the paper that defined and introduced BitCoin. You can skip "11. Calculations" if you don't like sigma symbols. URL and email address on top of the paper seem unbeliveable and added by third party.

- Felten et al 2015: [Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cryptocurrency/home/week/1), videos Week 1 (about 1 hour). Requires free registration. If you find it easy to follow, you can also optionally look at week 2 (1,5 h).

## **BitCoin: White paper summary**



#### **a)** Value of bit money. **How much is one BitCoin (BTC) worth now?** Using historical BTC course, show that you could have lost a lot of money investing in BTC. Also show that you could have won a lot of money with BTC.





#### **b) Is it legal to own BitCoin in Finland?** Why do you think so?

#### **c) What's a block chain?** Give a simple but detailed explanation. (Feel free to use the most narrow and simple definition of blockchain - no need to consider a whole cryptocurrency).
